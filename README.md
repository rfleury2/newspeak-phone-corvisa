# Newspeak Phone Corvisa
*Get current, online-sourced news right from your phone, even without an internet connection*

This is the repo that houses all of the code used for Corvisa's voice and text messaging API.  It communicates with a sister app created on Ruby on Rails.

## Project Description
Newspeak gives users a spoken digest of the most popular news on the New York Times feed (later, we would like to incorporate other news services).  Users initiate our app by calling a phone number.  The automated track takes the user through a menu of news categories and reads abstracts for the user selections.  The user can also have a full article link sent to their phone via SMS.

## Challenge
Newspeak was created as part of Techweek Chicago's 2015 Hackathon.  We had 24 hours to develop Newspeak and submit all code.
